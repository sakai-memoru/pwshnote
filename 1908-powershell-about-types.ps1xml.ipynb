    "### About Extended Type Data\n",
    "\n",
    "    Extended type data defines additional properties and methods (\"members\")\n",
    "    of object types in Windows PowerShell. You can extend any type that is \n",
    "    supported by Windows PowerShell and use the added properties and methods\n",
    "    in the same way that you use the properties that are defined on the object\n",
    "    types.\n",
    "\n",
    "    For example, Windows PowerShell adds a DateTime property to all \n",
    "    System.DateTime objects, such as the ones that the Get-Date cmdlet \n",

    "    You won't find the DateTime property in the description of the System.DateTime\n",
    "    structure (http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/system.datetime.aspx), \n",
    "    because Windows PowerShell adds the property and it is visible only in    \n",
    "    Windows PowerShell. \n",
    "\n",
    "    To add the DateTime property to all Windows PowerShell sessions, Windows PowerShell\n",

    "    PowerShell has built-in Types.ps1xml files that add several elements\n",
    "    to the .NET Framework types, but you can create additional Types.ps1xml\n",
    "    files to further extend the types.\n",
    "\n",
    "    For example, by default, array objects (System.Array) have a Length \n",
    "    property that lists the number of objects in the array. However, because\n",
    "    the name \"length\" does not clearly describe the property, Windows \n",
    "    PowerShell adds an alias property named \"Count\" that displays the same \n",
    "    value. The following XML adds the Count property to the System.Array type.\n",

    "\n",
    "    To get the new AliasProperty, use a Get-Member command on any array, as shown\n",

    "        Get-Member -inputobject (1,2,3,4)\n",

    "\n",
    "      To create a new file, start by copying an existing Types.ps1xml file. The\n",
    "      new file can have any name, but it must have a .ps1xml file name \n",
    "      extension. You can place the new file in any directory that is accessible\n",

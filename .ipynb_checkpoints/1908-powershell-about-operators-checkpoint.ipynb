      "    Describes the operators that are supported by Windows PowerShell. \n",
      "\n",
      "LONG DESCRIPTION\n",
      "    An operator is a language element that you can use in a command or\n",
      "    expression. Windows PowerShell supports several types of operators to\n",
      "    help you manipulate values.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  Arithmetic Operators\n",
      "      Use arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /, %) to calculate values in a command\n",
      "      or expression. With these operators, you can add, subtract, multiply, or\n",
      "      divide values, and calculate the remainder (modulus) of a division \n",
      "      operation.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "      You can also use arithmetic operators with strings, arrays, and hash \n",
      "      tables. The addition operator concatenates elements. The multiplication\n",
      "      operator returns the specified number of copies of each element.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "      For more information, see about_Arithmetic_Operators. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  Assignment Operators\n",
      "      Use assignment operators (=, +=, -=, *=, /=, %=) to assign one or more\n",
      "      values to variables, to change the values in a variable, and to append\n",
      "      values to variables. You can also cast the variable as any Microsoft .NET\n",
      "      Framework data type, such as string or DateTime, or Process variable.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "      For more information, see about_Assignment_Operators.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  Comparison Operators\n",
      "      Use comparison operators (-eq, -ne, -gt, -lt, -le, -ge) to compare values\n",
      "      and test conditions. For example, you can compare two string values to \n",
      "      determine whether they are equal. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "      The comparison operators include the match operators (-match, -notmatch), \n",
      "      which find patterns by using regular expressions; the replace operator \n",
      "      (-replace), which uses regular expressions to change input values; the\n",
      "      like operators (-like, -notlike), which find patterns using wildcard \n",
      "      characters (*); and the containment operators (-in, -notin, -contains, \n",
      "      -notcontains), which determine whether a test value appears in a reference\n",
      "      set.\n",
      "\n",
      "      They also include the bitwise operators (-bAND, -bOR, -bXOR, -bNOT) to \n",
      "      manipulate the bit patterns in values.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "    For more information, see about_Comparison_Operators \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  Logical Operators\n",
      "      Use logical operators (-and, -or, -xor, -not, !) to connect conditional\n",
      "      statements into a single complex conditional. For example, you can use a\n",
      "      logical -and operator to create an object filter with two different \n",
      "      conditions.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  Redirection Operators\n",
      "      Use redirection operators (>, >>, 2>, 2>, and 2>&1) to send the output of\n",
      "      a command or expression to a text file. The redirection operators work \n",
      "      like the Out-File cmdlet (without parameters) but they also let you \n",
      "      redirect error output to specified files. You can also use the Tee-Object\n",
      "      cmdlet to redirect output.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  Split and Join Operators\n",
      "      The -split and -join operators divide and combine substrings. The -split \n",
      "      operator splits a string into substrings. The -join operator concatenates\n",
      "      multiple strings into a single string.\n",
      "\n",

      "  Unary Operators\n",
      "      Use unary operators to increment or decrement variables or object \n",

      "  Special Operators\n",
      "      Use special operators to perform tasks that cannot be performed by the \n",

      "\n",
      "        <input> <operator> [.NET type]\n",
      "\n",
      "    You can also use the following syntax:\n",

      " \n",
      "\n",
      "    To specify the .NET Framework type, enclose the type name in \n",
      "    brackets ([ ]), or enter the type as a string, such as [DateTime] or \n",
      "    \"DateTime\" for System.DateTime. If the type is not at the root of the \n",
      "    system namespace, specify the full name of the object type. You can omit\n",

      "    [System.Diagnostics.Process], [Diagnostics.Process], or \n",
      "    \"diagnostics.process\". \n",
      "\n",
      "    The type operators always return a Boolean value, even if the input is a\n",
